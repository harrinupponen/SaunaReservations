# SaunaReservations
An exercise with Spring Boot 2, Thymeleaf, h2-database, CSS.

## How does it work
- Test the application in heroku:
https://saunareservations.herokuapp.com
- There's a little bit different rights with the "user" and "admin".
- Credentials:
username: user
password: user
OR
username : admin
password: admin

Basically just handling CRUD-features, GET, POST etc.
Also with simple Spring Boot Security features.
